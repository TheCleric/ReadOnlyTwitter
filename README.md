# ReadOnlyTwitter

Enhance your Twitter experience by preventing yourself from actually interacting.

By not interacting you're less likely to get sucked into useless arguments, which will make you happier in the long run.

Allow your Twitter stream to flow past you, and then let it go.

Options to disable tweets, retweets, likes, and direct messages.
